## Who I am

I am Zainab, a British born Somali northener,a nature lover who is into treking and hiking in the peak district and who gets excited about Tech. As a 2019 Manchester University graduate in Accounting, I decided to switch to tech and help to create bits of the future before the future leaves my sector unemployed. I am hardworking, like a good challenge and want to see how far my capabilities can take me. I have genuinely enjoyed studying different coding languages on my own but am happy to now grow through studying with Makers and alongside other Makers. In Tech there is a rush when you solve an error and it feels fulfilling to see how you've impoved a process or made something new possible through your work.
